This repository is a comprehensive collection of my work and explorations in the fields of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Generative AI (GenAI). Here, you will find a mix of conceptual explanations and practical projects that demonstrate the application of various algorithms and techniques.

# [Generative AI and LLM's](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Generative-AI-Projects)
**Concepts:** Detailed overviews of generative models including GANs, VAEs, and transformer-based architectures like GPT and BERT.

**Projects:** Exciting projects involving text generation, image synthesis, and prompt engineering. Includes my Flask-based text generator using Google Generative AI and the Google Gemini model.
